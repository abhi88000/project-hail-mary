**Multi-Business SaaS Platform**

This is a personal project where I am building a basic SaaS platform for service-based businesses.
It will support business onboarding, users, services, and appointments.
The goal is to learn backend development, architecture, and cloud by building a real system.

**Tech Stack**

Java, Spring Boot
PostgreSQL
Docker (later)
